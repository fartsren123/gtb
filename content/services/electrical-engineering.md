A program that focuses on strengthening the foundation of core engineering discipline while keeping up with the rapidly expanding, dynamic world of Electrical Engineering backed by world class labs and hand-on industry experience.

## PROGRAM OVERVIEW
Electrical Engineering is one of the largest and most diverse technological and Engineering disciplines in todayâ€™s world. This branch of Engineering deals with the study and application of Electricity, Electronics and Electromagnetism for the development and maintenance of Electrical and Electronics equipment such as electric motors, navigation systems, medical devices, broadcast and communication systems, power generation systems, electrical distribution systems, electric grids etc., while keeping in mind the safety, quality, economic feasibility and sustainability of these products and systems.

Based on the fundamentals of Physics and Mathematics, Electrical Engineering became a field of its own in the 19th century due to innovations such as the generator, motors, telephone, wireless communications and electronics. Ever since, this field has sure come a long way. Not only has it been one of the major driving forces behind cutting-edge technology in areas such as Power Engineering, Computer Engineering, Communications and Mobile Technologies, it has also significantly impacted several other fields such as Nanotechnology, Biomedical Engineering, Neuroscience and Biotechnology, etc.
