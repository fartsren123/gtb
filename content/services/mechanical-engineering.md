A program that focuses on the basics and advancement of Engineering fundamentals backed by state-of-the-art infrastructure, world-class faculty and a hands-on, practical approach that is in sync with the Mechanical Engineering Industry dynamics and demands.

## PROGRAM OVERVIEW
Mechanical Engineering is a discipline of Engineering that is concerned with the working mechanisms of heavy tools and machineries. It applies the principles of Physics and Materials Science for analysis, design, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. Students are introduced to the Science & Art of formulation, design, development and control of systems, with components involving Thermodynamics, Mechanics, Fluid Mechanics, mechanisms and conversion of energy. The program addresses both the quest to understand how things work and the desire to put this understanding to practical use. Students are constantly guided by faculty of national and international recognition, who are also members of prestigious Engineering societies and counted among the outstanding scholars in their profession.

The Science of Mechanical Engineering emerged in the 19th century as a result of developments in the field of physics. The field has continually evolved to incorporate advancements in technology. Mechanical Engineers today are pursuing developments in fields such as composites, Mechatronics and Nanotechnology.

At GTB KIET, our expert faculty is committed to the advancement of the fundamental Engineering Sciences encountered by undergraduates in a curriculum that is heavy in “basics.” This is balanced by their demonstrated interest and active participation in practical developments as well.

## CAMPUS RECRUITMENT
Mechanical Engineers are required in all manufacturing facilities. The working criteria of a Mechanical Engineer changes according to the type and domain of the company they are working with and the area of specialisation. In a broader sense it can be said that a Mechanical Engineer works on design and control of a system that goes into the process of manufacturing the machinery and product. He tests new systems for feasibility and efficiency and carries out quality management and improvement process.

There is tremendous scope for Mechanical Engineers in industries including Aerospace, Automotive, Biomedical, Chemical, Computers, Electronics, Fossil and Nuclear Power, Manufacturing, Pharmaceutical, Robotics and Textiles. Further, the scope of employment extends into areas of research & development, design, testing and evaluation, manufacturing, operations & maintenance, marketing, sales and administration. Public sector units like Railways, ONGC, Indian Oil, ISRO, SAIL, NTPC, DDRO and IAF, also have ample job opportunities for Mechanical Engineers.

Leading Mechanical and Automotive companies visit the campus regularly for placement. Our Engineers have successfully obtained placements at leading companies such as Infosys, Godrej, Escort, L&T, Wipro, ISMT, Mahindra & Mahindra, JCB, Eicher, among others.
