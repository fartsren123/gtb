A balanced program that integrates foundational understanding of Engineering and Applied Sciences, with practical skills and knowledge that are adaptable to the present and future Engineering design challenges in the real world.

## PROGRAM OVERVIEW
Civil Engineers conceive, design, build, supervise, operate, construct and maintain infrastructure projects and systems in the public and private sector, including roads, buildings, airports, tunnels, dams, bridges, and systems for water supply and sewage treatment.

Engineers work with many other professionals in teams to make our world a better place. Their work space may include different places, like offices and laboratories, far-flung or not so common sites or places others never get to go, such as underground and at sea! These opportunities make Civil Engineering one of the most exciting careers choices around.

* Earthquake Engineers make sure structures can withstand earthquakes.
* Environmental Engineers protect the environment and protect us from extreme weather.
* Geo-technical Engineers focus on the ground, which affects everything built on it (buildings), with it (dams and levees) and in it (tunnels and pipelines).
* Project Management Engineers make sure entire projects are delivered on time and on budget.

A Degree in Civil Engineering covers a plethora of scientific topics, including, Mechanics, Hydraulics, Materials Science and Statistical Analysis. At the Chitkara University, the study of these foundation subjects will be complemented with the development of design skills, with computer-aided designs in particular. The final year will involve field trips and the conception of several personal or team projects, which will further play an important role to provide on-the-job training and real-life application of knowledge.

## CAMPUS RECRUITMENT
A career in Civil Engineering is satisfying, challenging and offers promising prospects for upward progression. It is expected that the demand for Civil Engineers all over the world will only grow in the coming years. Engineering companies all over the world are in need of Civil Engineers to develop new technologies, build better buildings, create better cities, get people to where they want to go in the best way possible, and counter the devastating effects of climate change. In other words, to improve the future of the planet. This means that the Civil Engineers of tomorrow (you!) are in demand. With a good education and a positive attitude, you will be able to secure an exciting, well paying job that offers you opportunities to work at the cutting edge of your field, all over the globe.
